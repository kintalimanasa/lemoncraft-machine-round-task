   # Approach and Challenges

To approach this task, I first studied the provided video and recreated the exact design and layout of the two sections using CSS and React. I then implemented the scroll-down and scroll-up effects using CSS animations and JavaScript.

One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the smooth transition between the two sections. I overcame this by using CSS transitions and JavaScript to animate the sections.

Another challenge was optimizing the performance of the web page. I achieved this by using efficient asset loading and caching.
